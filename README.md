uploadr
=======

Yet another Flickr uploading script.

Requires the [python flickr api](https://github.com/alexis-mignon/python-flickr-api).

This program assumes that all the images in a directory belong to a set with the same name. It then makes sure that each file is uploaded, and a member of that set.

Options exist to deal with files existing in the set, but not being found locally, and for downloading sets.
